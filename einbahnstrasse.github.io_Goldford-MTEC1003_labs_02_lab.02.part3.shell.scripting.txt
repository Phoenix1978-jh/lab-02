What command did you use, and what was its output?
----------
date
Wed Sep  6 19:53:59 EDT 2023

==========
3. Go to your home directory. 
Then navigate to your mtec1003-lab-02 folder with a single command. 
Finally, verify that you're in the right place.

What 3 commands did you use to do this?
----------
cd ~
cd ~ /mtec1003-lab-02
pwd





==========
4. Create an empty file called copy_to_backup.sh. 
Verify that the file exists.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
shell scripts:
on the terminal's command prompt, you can only run one commnad a time.
A shell script, on the other hand,allows you to LIST multiple commands to be executed one after another.
When you run the shell script on the command line, then it executes everything in order contained in the script.

touch copy_to_backup.sh 
ls




==========
5. What are the permissions on your copy_to_backup.sh.

What command did you use to find the permissions?
----------
-rw-r--r--  1 jasminehernandez  staff  0 Sep  6 20:05 copy_to_backup.sh

ls -l




==========
6. Change the permissions so that this file is executable by the user.
Verify the new permissions.

What commands did you use to do this?  What was the output?
----------
chmod u+x copy_to_backup.sh

ls -l

-rwxr--r--  1 jasminehernandez  staff  0 Sep  6 20:05 copy_to_backup.sh




==========
7. Try executing the file!

$ ./copy_to_backup.sh

What command did you use to try to execute the file? What happens?
----------
./copy_to_backup.sh

nada

9. In your file, write the commands to do the following

a. create a directory called backup 
b. copy all of the txt files in the current directory to the backup directory (use *.txt)
c. print out "I'm done backing up"

Don't forget the first line of your shell script! It should begin with #!/bin/bash)!

Write out the code you typed into your file below...
----------

#!/bin/bash
mkdir backup
cp -r -v *.txt backup
echo "I'm done backing up!"

----------



==========
11. Go into that directory and create two empty files... 1.txt and 2.txt

What commands did you use to do this?

mkdir test
cd ~/test
touch 1.txt 2.txt

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
cd ~/mtec1003-lab-02
mv copy_to_backup.sh ~/test
cd ~/test
ls 
(output:    1.txt			2.txt			copy_to_backup.sh )

==========
13. Run your script.

What commands did you use to do this?

-rwxr--r--@ 1 jasminehernandez  staff   76 Sep  6 20:25 copy_to_backup.sh





==========
15. To finish up, using your mouse or with Terminal commands, save this file and be sure it's inside your mtec1003-lab-02 folder. (If not, move it into this folder.)
